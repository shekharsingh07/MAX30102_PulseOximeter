**Description:** <br>For my undergraduate thesis, I designed a PCB for a fingertip Pulse oximeter. The pulse oximeter would use Maxim Integrated's MAX30102 biometric sensor and is created for 24hr monitoring.
<br>The project is divided into two sections:
<ol>
  <li>The embbeded software design:
    <ul>
      <li>Which is further subdivided into sections based on the components - the memory, the I/O system, and the sensor</li>
      <li>The embedded design revolves around the STM32G071RB microcontroller</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>The PCB design:
    <ul>
      <li>Which contains the necessary files to manufacture this Pulse Oximeter PCB.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>
